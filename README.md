# Typogamy
A text based game made for practice and fun. Also a sort of predecessor to "Light Crawler". 
Rogue-like that features permanent character death.
For debugging/messing around you can name your character Arithmancer for unlimited lives, no insanity, and unlimited stamina.
Game may not work on first run when the compile files are created.
Quitting and opening the game too quickly may cause it to crash upon reopening.
Careful with having volume too loud as some of the songs bass notes are too low for most speakers to output properly at high volumes causing some
very undesirable distortion.
